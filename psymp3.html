		<h1>History</h1>
		<p>PsyMP3 was started as a personal project in FreeBASIC using FMOD in 2008.
		In 2011, the old FreeBASIC codebase was set aside and the entire project was
		rearchitected from the ground-up in modern C++, using advanced features of C++17
		to achieve high-performance and memory safety.</p>
